        The Series class is used to add time series data to the model.
        Time series data can be required in the Source class to implement data
        for keyword arguments 'commodity_rate_min',Â´'commodity_rate_max',
        'commodity_rate_fix'. Additionally, they might be needed to a add time-
        dependent commodity cost or revenues, or generally for scripting of
        user expressions (added via 'time_series_data' argument).

        :param name: Name of the time series data instance (string). Can be
            used for scripting of user expressions.
