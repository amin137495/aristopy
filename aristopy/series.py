        The Series class is used to add time series data to the model.
        Time series data can be required in the Source class to implement data

        'commodity_rate_fix'. Additionally, they might be needed to a add time-
        dependent commodity cost or revenues, or generally for scripting of
        user expressions (added via 'time_series_data' argument).

            used for scripting of user expressions.
