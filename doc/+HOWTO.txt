How to setup and run the SPHINX documentation generator
=======================================================

* When a project is set up for sphinx for the first time: run "sphinx_quickstart"
* The main properties are now in file "conf.py" and can be changed after initialization
* To run a builder:
	# Open command window (or Anaconda prompt)
	# Goto the "doc" folder of your project
	# Run the make-file with the desired builder (html, latex, ...)
		E.g.: >> make html
	# To see the documentation goto the ".built" directory and open created files 
	  (E.g.: html -> index.html)
