Welcome to aristopy's documentation!
====================================

The Python package *aristopy* is a framework for modeling and optimizing the design and operation of energy systems.
The name of the framework is derived from the great Greek thinker Aristotle. For Aristotle, planning and the wise use of human goods represented great virtues. 
Transferred to today's time and the design of energy systems, this implies using appropriate tools that support the planning process and contribute to an optimal use of the available resources (money, fuel, etc.).
